/**
 * @brief Blueprint Function Library for Rock Cosmetics.
 *
 * This function library provides a collection of static utility functions that facilitate the construction and
 * configuration of actors with customizable objects and their associated usage components. These functions enable
 * developers to easily integrate customizable skeletal mesh components into actors via both C++ and Blueprint workflows.
 *
 * The library includes functions for:
 * - Creating and attaching customizable object instances to actors.
 * - Instantiating customizable objects directly.
 * - Cloning existing customizable object instances to prevent modification of original instances.
 *
 * @see BuildCustomizableActor(...) for details on how customizable actors are constructed.

	 * @brief Attaches and configures a customizable object instance to the given actor.

	 * This function creates the required skeletal mesh components based on the number of components
	 * in the provided customizable object instance. For the first component, it uses the actorâ€™s root component;
	 * for subsequent components, it creates new skeletal mesh components, attaches them to the actor, and registers them.
	 * Each component is associated with a corresponding usage component that is configured with the customizable instance
	 * and a name retrieved from the customizable object.
	 *
	 * @param Actor The actor to which the customizable object instance will be attached.
	 * @param CustomizableObject The customizable object that defines the component configuration.
	 * @param CustomizableObject The instance of the customizable object to attach to the actor.
