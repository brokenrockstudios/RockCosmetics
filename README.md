# What is Mutable?

Mutable is a plugin system that helps make creating incredibly efficient customizable Skeletal Meshes and Static Meshes easier. 
It is a system that allows you to create a base mesh and then apply a series of modifications to it to create a new mesh. These modifications can be anything from changing the color of the mesh to adding new parts to the mesh. The system is designed to be as flexible as possible, allowing you to create a wide variety of different meshes with a single base mesh.

Unlike traditional systems where you have to do copy poses and have multiple Skeletal Meshes, with mutable you can have it generate a runtime merged skeletal mesh. 
This is incredibly efficient!

Epic purchased Mutable from Anticto.
